# ecorss

## Overview
`ecorss` is a growing project that processes and aggregates RSS feeds from various ecology related journals. The project includes a build script that fetches, processes, and organizes articles into a JSON file, which is then deployed to GitHub Pages. At this point the backbone is working, but I plan to expand functionality and scale in the future.

## Features
- Lightweight, up-to-date RSS feed of ecology journals.
- No bias in article selection due to algorithms.
- Completely open source service without monetization concerns.

## Collaborate
Journal suggestions and contributions to open issues are always welcome. The main issue right are inadequately managed RSS feeds and non-standardized formatting that lead to problems during processing. Further functionality is always optional and should serve optimization, scale and ease of use for the user by adding a larger database and more features. The goal is to remain lightweight and keep an intuitive and simple UI.
